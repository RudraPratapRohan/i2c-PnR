I²C Controller Physical Design using Cadence Innovus
This project implements the physical design (Place and Route) of an I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) controller using Cadence Innovus. The flow includes floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and timing optimization to achieve design closure. The I²C controller is designed to facilitate low-speed serial communication between integrated circuits, adhering to performance, area, and power constraints. This repository contains the complete PnR flow and scripts used for the implementation.
